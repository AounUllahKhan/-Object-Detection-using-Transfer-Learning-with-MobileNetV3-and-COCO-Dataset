# -Object-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning-with-MobileNetV3-and-COCO-Dataset
I'm excited to share that I've implemented object detection using transfer learning with MobileNetV3 and the COCO dataset. This project was a great opportunity to learn more about object detection and transfer learning.

I started by downloading the COCO dataset and creating a custom dataset of images that I wanted to detect. I then used the MobileNetV3 pre-trained model as a starting point and fine-tuned it on my custom dataset.

The results were very promising! The model was able to detect objects with a high degree of accuracy. I'm excited to continue working on this project and to see how it can be used in real-world applications.
